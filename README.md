# Java Chat Application
This program is a client-server network which allows for multiple instances of clients
to be created and connect to the same server. While they are connected, the clients will be able 
to send messages to each other directly and see each other's usernames. 
## How to Use
- Find directory Server.java is located in and run following command:
```bash
java Server.java
```
After doing so, your Server will be running and listening for clients.
- Find directory Client.java is located in and run following command:
```bash
java Client.java
```
After doing so, you will see that a new client has been connected to server.
- Open a new command prompt window and run Client.java again to connect more clients to server.
- After specifying their usernames, clients will be able to converse directly.
